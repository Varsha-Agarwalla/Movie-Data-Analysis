- What am I trying to answer?

What makes a movie popular?

How accurately can we predict the popularity?

- How to go about this?

I will look into various data columns and study if there is any association between the movie ratings and audience and critic scores. I would also see if the ratings depend on the genre type of the movies.

- How will it be useful?

Recently I watched a movie without reading the reviews or checking the ratings and my experience wasnâ€™t good. So, I would like to see how the audience rating is calculated and what factors do they consider when they like a movie. I would also like to see how if IMDB rating is associated with the rating in Rotten Tomatoes.
